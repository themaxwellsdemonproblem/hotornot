                      <p>I fell in love with music early in life, and while my life as a musician began with the
                        trumpet
                        and the piano, I knew I
                        really wanted to play guitar. Being in a band seemed like lots of fun to pre-teen Chris, and
                        being
                        a rock star would
                        obviously be extremely cool. The chance finally came around the tail end of freshman year of
                        high
                        school in New York
                        City in the year 2000, when Evan and I started hanging out and decided we should start a band.
                        He
                        already played guitar
                        and had recently gotten a Fender Strat that was this deep beautiful purple color, and we knew
                        some
                        other guys who played
                        guitar, so I figured it would be easiest for me to learn the bass and then <span
                          class="highlighter">we'd find a
                          drummer eventually.</span> My Uncle
                        Brian passed down to me an old Fender Jazz Bass copy he had sitting around that went unplayed
                        for
                        years. The next year
                        in spring 2001, Evan introduced me to Mattio, who was about to graduate, was already in a
                        band,
                        and lived pretty close
                        to me in Jersey. After an initial afterschool jam in a classroom, we got Matt to come out to
                        my
                        Aunt Patty's place in Ho
                        Ho Kus NJ where she had an old barn out back that was generally gathering dust. We hauled our
                        little amps up to the barn
                        loft and proceeded to make a serious racket for the rest of that summer, and the summer after,
                        and
                        any other time Mattio
                        came home from college. We ran old cassette recorders and four tracks to record our earliest
                        fumbling attempts at
                        songwriting, and learned how to get sounds on tape in a way that made us happy even if they
                        didn't
                        actually sound very
                        good. The Barn was the physical space we needed to become a real band, the place to play
                        together
                        that every band needs
                        to become what it is. We owe the Portanova family big time for gracing us with that space and
                        gamely putting up with our
                        musical growing pains for all those years.<span class="attr">-CJN</span></p>

                      <p>So here’s where it started: I think I actually remember what staircase we were in, in high
                        school, when Evan and Chris
                        stopped me and Evan said, “Hey. Wanna come over to Chris’s aunt’s house and jam with us some
                        weekend?” So I’d fill the
                        tank in my parent’s station wagon with a twenty and cross county lines to pick him up, take
                        him
                        to
                        Chris’s, or we’d go
                        to Guitar Center to fiddle and dream. "Fake Plastic Trees" and other songs about the suburbs
                        were
                        in the tape deck. We
                        knew New York City. We were raised to believe that the world was ours, but we wanted something
                        realer than that. <span class="highlighter">We
                          wanted art and we found it in each other</span>, in the barn, and in late-night studio jam
                        sessions in Jersey City with Evan’s
                        dad Mike, a drummer of great timing and patience who was more than happy to lay it down as we
                        learned our instruments.

                      <p>This song by Evan holds up the best out of anything from the first era of the band, back when
                        we called ourselves Green
                        (after talking Mattio out of “The Normal”). We tracked this in my bedroom in Glen Rock like so
                        much of the stuff we
                        recorded early in college, after our earliest high school days jamming and four-tracking in
                        the
                        loft of the Barn at Aunt
                        Patty’s place nearby. This was probably the last song where I played bass on record before
                        switching to six-string and

                        of north Jersey
                        highways, of running with guitars slung over shoulders and amps lashed onto rattly handcarts
                        to
                        catch train rides over
                        and under swamps and rivers. We met in high school in New York, and finally moved there years
                        later, but New Jersey is
                        where our music came from, at least in 2004.

                      <p>Being teenagers in New Jersey in the 1990s meant we were always looking for <span

                          better.</span> I
                        would fill the gas tank
                        in my parents' station wagon with a twenty and cross county lines to pick up Evan, take him to
                        Chris’s, and then we’d go
                        to Guitar Center to noodle and dream. "Fake Plastic Trees" and other songs about the suburbs
                        were in
                        the tape deck. We
                        knew New York City. We were raised to believe that the world was ours, and we didn't want it -
                        we
                        wanted something
                        realer. We were smart, I guess, but nobody is wise at that age. Still, Evan could really dish
                        out
                        some poetry from
                        behind an acoustic guitar: "There must be someone out there trying to talk to us". <span

                      <p>Having made it through years spent recording the terrible and long jams of beginners and
                        learners,
                        now exploring our
                        world as songwriters, we took another step. We got better at the drums though none of us was a
                        drummer. Chris abandoned
                        the bass in favor of the guitar and the pen. We found the pitch - most of the time. And so by
                        the
                        time I graduated from
                        college - with Evan and Chris soon to follow - those barn jams and bedroom practice
                        sessions resulted in
                        Signal-to-Noise, <span class="highlighter">fully equipped</span> as a rock band with our own
                        tentative
                        drumming, more distortion, and
                        one less
                        instrumental jam than Fitter/Happier. “Big World” was a big step forward for us in precision
                        - not the least of which involved the tiny turns of the knob on Chris’s Marshall amp to get
                        the
                        perfect delay timing on
                        my rhythm guitar.

                      <p>“Big World” wasn’t just the first time I ever played drums on a track: it was practically the
                        first time I ever played
                        drums, period. I had gone back to the Barn, dug up my cousin Brennan’s battered old drum set
                        from his 90s NJ punk/ska
                        band, and dragged it up to my attic room in Glen Rock. We only had a high-hat cymbal, no crash
                        or ride. I had been
                        playing guitar for a while by then but had never been confident in my early attempts at
                        songwriting until this point,
                        and adding drums to the mix seemed like a good idea too. It was the summer of 2005, after
                        sophomore year of college, and
                        I was an intern at Men’s Health Magazine in New York. We spent a weekend in the Glen Rock
                        attic
                        to record the whole
                        Signal to Noise EP, and we were having such a time <span class="highlighter">I called in sick
                          to

                        finish the job. Upon my return to work, my editor made me write a sidebar piece (ostensibly
                        for
                        the magazine) about why
                        there is technically no such thing as the stomach flu. It is actually called gastroenteritis,
                        a
                        kindly doctor informed
                        me. Whatever you call it, I didn’t have it. <span class="attr">-CJN</span></p>

                        spend a lot of time just

                      <p>I’m still surprised I wrote this song when I did. It’s deeply personal and autobiographical,
                        and traces the difference
                        between the suburbs Chris and Matt grew up in, and the city I grew up in. It’s written in the
                        second person to my
                        great-grandfather, who lived in the same rowhouse my parents live in today. This song also set
                        up a kind of aesthetic I
                        always liked and that served our band well -- me doing something <span

                        than my forever-out-of-tune Epiphone Sheraton jazz guitar and my janky Marshall solid state

                        At that first club show we ever played at Don Hill’s this summer of 2005, my hometown
                        acquaintance Pat Stickles (who had
                        recently founded the band Titus Andronicus) was in attendance and told me that we sounded like a
                        jazz band on Evan’s
                        songs, an emo band on Mattio’s songs, and an indie rock band on my songs. This is ostensibly one
                        of the “jazz band”
                        songs. It remained in our live repertoire for years longer than most of the other Signal to

                        still recorded this with the learning/jamming attitude (teach me a song in the afternoon and
                        we’ll record it in the
                        evening), so there are a few cues that are still all over the place, but <span

                        over the course of a year or so. I cribbed the Talking Heads name because we were living through

                        hooking up with the same people, and how the navel-gazing self-consciousness of youth reads as
                        brash indifference. We
                        had fun. For us with our privilege, <span class="highlighter">life during wartime was just,
                          life.</span>
                        This is the era where we actually recorded into a laptop like a real band. I sang this through a
                        tube-overdrive pedal
                        loaded with a prized Telefunken 12AX7 I scored for cheap at a flea market. I remember this being
                        the era where I would
                        drink a bud heavy or three and shout ‘guys lets run this whole mix through a walkman and get
                        that ‘tape’ sound!’
                        It still burns me that the guy we paid too much to do the original mastering tried his best with
                        our terrible recording
                        techniques, but there are still little stereo artifacts in there.

                      <p>A short year or two after “Big World,” Chris had signed a lease on an apartment in Bushwick and
                        we moved our amplifiers
                        in. I was in the Bronx and Evan was in Jersey City but that’s close enough for rock and roll.
                        Our twenties were still
                        fresh and new, our jobs were awful, but for the first time in five or six years (out of about
                        seven as a band, by that
                        point), we were all in the same place again. So we got together <span class="highlighter">over
                          Buds from the bodega</span> across
                        the street from Chris’s
                        place, taught each other the new songs, and started making plans to record a real record.</p>
                      <p>We - well, Chris, but really all of us - were bad neighbors, but I’ll say this: we turned the
                        amps off at 8pm. We were
                        pretty clueless, but not completely.</p>
                      <p>“Jeff Tweedy’s Daughter” because it was a mashup of Wilco and Sonic Youth.

                      <p>By the summer of 2007 Bushwick was on the hipster radar (otherwise our erstwhile bassist Dugan
                        and I never would have
                        moved there) but the Dekalb Ave L stop at that point had zero gentrifying hipster
                        “infrastructure” and not really any
                        other hipsters yet. The first few months in that shotgun apartment on a block that still bore
                        the scars of arson in the
                        70s was a real eye-opener for old Chris Norton, who was fresh out of the collegiate privilege
                        bubble by about one month.
                        I wholeheartedly thought/knew New York was the greatest city on earth and i would probably live
                        there til I died and
                        have my ashes scattered in the East River, but who was I kidding? I was totally unprepared for
                        what it was like to live
                        in a working class city neighborhood. As such, it was easy to do <span
                          class="highlighter">totally rude and perhaps even
                          antisocial things</span> like
                        fill an entire closet in one room of said shotgun apartment to the ceiling with a stack of
                        amplifiers, shove in the old
                        drums, play guitars as insanely loud and noisy as you hear on this track, and call it Hangover
                        Studios. We alienated a
                        whole lot of neighbors, made friends of convenience with others, and I’m proud to keep calling a
                        handful of them friends
                        to this day. We were 110% powered by six packs of Budweiser heavy tall boys from the bodega
                        across the street and
                        plentiful cheap weed. I got bedbugs, I had panic attacks, and I had so much fun despite how
                        awful everything was that I
                        didn’t care at all.
