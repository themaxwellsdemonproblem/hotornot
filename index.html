                      <p>I fell in love with music early in life, and while my life as a musician began with the trumpet
                        and the piano, I knew I
                        really wanted to play guitar. Being in a band seemed like lots of fun to pre-teen Chris, and
                        being a rock star would
                        obviously be extremely cool. The chance finally came around the tail end of freshman year of
                        high school in New York
                        City in the year 2000, when Evan and I started hanging out and decided we should start a band.
                        He already played guitar
                        and had recently gotten a Fender Strat that was this deep beautiful purple color, and we
                        knew some other guys who played guitar, so I figured it would be easiest for me to learn the
                        bass and then we'd find a
                        drummer eventually. My Uncle Brian passed down to me an old Fender Jazz Bass copy he had sitting
                        around that went
                        unplayed for years, and resident family guitar wizard Uncle Steve showed me how to make that
                        bass thump the way I
                        wanted. The next year in spring 2001, Evan introduced me to Mattio, who was about to graduate,
                        was already in a band,
                        and lived pretty close to me in Jersey. After an initial afterschool jam in a classroom, we got
                        Matt to come out to my
                        Aunt Patty's place in Ho Ho Kus NJ where she had <span class="highlighter">an old barn out back
                          that was generally gathering dust.</span> We hauled our
                        little amps up to the barn loft and proceeded to make a serious racket for the rest of that
                        summer, and the summer
                        after, and any other time Mattio came home from college. We ran old cassette recorders to record
                        our earliest fumbling
                        attempts at songwriting, and learned how to get sounds on tape in a way that made us happy even
                        if they didn't actually
                        sound very good. The Barn was the physical space we needed to become a real band, the place to
                        play together that every
                        band needs to become what it is. We owe the Portanova family big time for gracing us with that
                        space and gamely putting
                        up with our musical growing pains for all those years.<span class="attr">-CJN</span></p>

                    <div class="inset2 my-4">
                      <p>So here’s where it started: I think I actually remember what staircase we were in, in high
                        school, when Evan and Chris
                        stopped me and Evan said, “Hey. Wanna come over to Chris’s aunt’s house and jam with us some
                        weekend?” So I’d fill the
                        tank in my parent’s station wagon with a twenty and cross county lines to pick him up, take
                        him
                        to
                        Chris’s, or we’d go
                        to Guitar Center to fiddle and dream. "Fake Plastic Trees" and other songs about the suburbs
                        were
                        in the tape deck. We
                        knew New York City. We were raised to believe that the world was ours, but we wanted something
                        realer than that. <span class="highlighter">We
                          wanted art and we found it in each other</span>, in the barn, and in late-night studio jam
                        sessions in Jersey City with Evan’s
                        dad Mike, a drummer of great timing and patience who was more than happy to lay it down as we
                        learned our instruments.

                  <div class="col-md-6">

                    <div class="inset my-4">
                      I grew up in a musical family. My father trained as a jazz drummer in Harlem in his 20’s, and
                      music was always an
                      assumed part of life when I was growing up. When I was 13, he bought me my first guitar, a used
                      Epiphone acoustic, which
                      I learned to play on long-distance phone calls with my cousin in upstate New York. Once I knew my
                      way around and wanted
                      to make more noise, my grandpa helped me buy the electric guitar I wanted - a made-in-Mexico
                      Fender Stratocaster,
                      metallic blue with a rosewood fretboard and a humbucker in the bridge. To date, it’s the only
                      guitar where I’ve <span class="highlighter">worn the
                        frets down to the wood.</span> I got the guitar the same summer I started spending countless
                      weekends at
                      Chris’ house, so the
                      next step was obvious: live the dream, start a band. Chris’ house, and later his Aunt Patty’s
                      barn, would become our
                      creative home for the next seven years. Everyone bought a microphone and a cable. I sprung for a
                      tiny little mixer, and
                      we ran everything into a single-deck tape recorder from the 70s we found covered in cobwebs in
                      Ho-Ho-Kus. There was no
                      tracking. If the mix wasn’t right, we had to take it from the top. We won’t make you listen to
                      those songs, but
                      recording that way requires and forms a bond - and a dedication to making music - that’s hard to
                      shake. <span class="attr">-ESB</span>

                        Buick, an hour past the
                        learner’s permit curfew, on my way back from playing guitar at Chris’ house. They rise out of
                        the otherwise <span class="highlighter">nothingness
                          of the Meadowlands,</span> and they’ve made an appearance in at least one later Le Samourai
                        song. By my
                        memory, someone took a
                        handheld recorder to the escalators of one PATH station or another to get that little sound bed
                        under the intro guitar
                        riff, but Matt and Chris say they recorded a NJ Transit train on its way past Glen Rock.

                      <p>This song by Evan holds up the best out of anything from the first era of the band, back when
                        we called ourselves Green
                        (after talking Mattio out of “The Normal”). We tracked this in my bedroom in Glen Rock like so
                        much of the stuff we
                        recorded early in college, after our earliest high school days jamming and recording to cassette
                        in the loft of the Barn
                        at Aunt Patty’s place nearby. This was probably the last song where I played bass on record
                        before switching to
                        six-string and drums. I hear this and think of those <span class="highlighter">night drives on
                          the Turnpike</span> and the rest of the awful web of north
                        Jersey highways, of running with guitars slung over shoulders and amps lashed onto rattly
                        handcarts to catch train rides
                        over and under swamps and rivers. We met in high school in New York, and finally moved there
                        years later, but New Jersey
                        is where our music came from, at least back then circa 2004.

                      <p>Once I went away to college we’d email each other staticky versions of songs we wrote and tell
                        the others to come up
                        with parts for the songs. One day Evan called with a proposal: “We each buy a microphone, plug
                        them into my little
                        German mixer, run it into the reel-to-reel tape recorder I found, and we record our own album!”
                        <span class="highlighter">It felt audacious, at
                          the time.</span> We mostly recorded experiments, jams, and our own learning processes.
                        <em>Fitter, Happier,
                          and More Productive</em> was
                        the tightest and most mature set from those years. In hindsight it sounds crazy to compress over
                        three years of musical
                        education into one track but here we are.

                      <p>Having made it through years spent recording the terrible and long jams of beginners and
                        learners, now exploring our
                        world as songwriters, we took another step. We got better at the drums though none of us was a
                        drummer. Chris abandoned
                        the bass in favor of the guitar and the pen. We found the pitch - most of the time. And so by
                        the time I graduated from
                        college - with Evan and Chris to follow a couple years later - those barn jams and bedroom
                        practice sessions resulted in
                        Signal-to-Noise, <span class="highlighter">fully equipped as a rock band</span> with our own
                        tentative drumming, more distortion, and one less
                        instrumental jam than Fitter/Happier. “Big World” was a big step forward for all of us in
                        precision and timing together
                        - not the least of which involved the tiny turns of the knob on Chris’s Marshall amp to get the
                        perfect delay timing on
                        my rhythm guitar. This one was written for my guy Tom Hutcheon, across the booth at The Cottage
                        Bar in Teaneck, the
                        summer after we finished college. What would come next was uncertain, but Evan and Chris started
                        talking about moving to
                        NYC after graduation, we started thinking over new names for the band, and we started making
                        plans.

                      <p>“Big World” wasn’t just the first time I ever played drums on a track: it was practically the
                        first time I ever played
                        drums, period. I had gone back to the Barn, dug up my cousin Brennan’s battered old drum set
                        from his 90s NJ punk/ska
                        band, and dragged it up to my attic room in Glen Rock. We only had a high-hat cymbal, no crash
                        or ride. I had been
                        playing guitar for a while by then but had never been confident in my early attempts at
                        songwriting until this point,
                        and adding drums to the mix seemed like a good idea too. It was the summer of 2005, after
                        sophomore year of college, and
                        I was an intern at Men’s Health Magazine in New York. We spent a weekend in the Glen Rock attic
                        to record the whole
                        Signal to Noise EP, and we were having such a time <span class="highlighter">I called in sick to
                          work Monday</span> with the “stomach flu” so we could
                        finish the job. Upon my return to work, my editor made me write a sidebar piece (ostensibly for
                        the magazine) about why
                        there is technically no such thing as the stomach flu. It is actually called gastroenteritis, a
                        kindly doctor informed
                        me. Whatever you call it, I didn’t have it.

                        microphones we bought for the Barn (I last used mine to record lead guitar a year ago - still
                        kicking). This song always
                        makes me think of our sneaking into <span class="highlighter">some now-dead bar</span> or
                        another underage, Matt holding forth about something. This was
                        the era when we realized our guitars would make big loud noises if we let them, and we began to
                        spend a lot of time just
                        letting the texture of the sound run wild.

                        between the suburbs Chris and Matt grew up in, and the city I grew up in. It’s written in the

                        great-grandfather, who lived in the same rowhouse my parents live in today. This song also set

                        Pat Stickles (who had
                        recently founded the band Titus Andronicus) was in attendance and told me that we sounded like a
                        jazz band on Evan’s
                        songs, an emo band on Mattio’s songs, and an indie rock band on my songs. This is ostensibly one
                        of the “jazz band”
                        songs. It remained in our live repertoire for years longer than most of the other Signal to

                        always fun to <span class="highlighter">rip into this and take off into space.</span> This song
                        consistently let me enjoy the most fun I ever had playing

                      <p>Man I still fucking love this choppy riff. This started as a jam we codenamed “Jeff Tweedy’s
                        Daughter,” and developed
                        over the course of a year or so. I cribbed the Talking Heads name because we were living through
                        a war that didn’t touch
                        us in any way. The lyrics are all about early-twenties sex and bravado, how a few of us were all
                        flirting with and
                        hooking up with the same people, and how the navel-gazing self-consciousness of youth reads as
                        brash indifference. We
                        had fun. For us with our privilege, <span class="highlighter">life during wartime was just,
                          life.</span>
                        This is the era where we actually recorded into a laptop like a real band. I sang this through a
                        tube-overdrive pedal
                        loaded with a prized Telefunken 12AX7 I scored for cheap at a flea market. I remember this being
                        the era where I would
                        drink a bud heavy or three and shout ‘guys lets run this whole mix through a walkman and get
                        that ‘tape’ sound!’
                        It still burns me that the guy we paid too much to do the original mastering tried his best with
                        our terrible recording
                        techniques, but there are still little stereo artifacts in there.

                      <p>A short year or two after “Big World,” Chris had signed a lease on an apartment in Bushwick and
                        we moved our amplifiers
                        in. I was in the Bronx and Evan was in Jersey City but that’s close enough for rock and roll.
                        Our twenties were still
                        fresh and new, our jobs were awful, but for the first time in five or six years (out of about
                        seven as a band, by that
                        point), we were all in the same place again. So we got together <span class="highlighter">over
                          Buds from the bodega</span> across
                        the street from Chris’s
                        place, taught each other the new songs, and started making plans to record a real record.</p>
                      <p>We - well, Chris, but really all of us - were bad neighbors, but I’ll say this: we turned the
                        amps off at 8pm. We were
                        pretty clueless, but not completely.</p>
                      <p>“Jeff Tweedy’s Daughter” because it was a mashup of Wilco and Sonic Youth.

                      <p>By the summer of 2007 Bushwick was on the hipster radar (otherwise our erstwhile bassist Kevin
                        and I never would have
                        moved there) but the DeKalb Ave L train stop at that point had zero gentrifying hipster
                        “infrastructure” and few if any
                        other hipsters yet. The first few months in that shotgun apartment on a block that still bore
                        the scars of arson in the
                        70s was a real eye-opener for me, fresh out of the collegiate privilege bubble by about one
                        month. I wholeheartedly
                        thought (knew) that New York was the greatest city on earth and I would probably live there til
                        I died and have my ashes
                        scattered in the East River, but who was I kidding? I was totally unprepared for what it was
                        like to live in a working
                        class city neighborhood. As such, it was easy to do <span class="highlighter">totally rude and
                          perhaps even antisocial</span> things like fill an entire
                        closet in one room of said shotgun apartment to the ceiling with a stack of amplifiers, shove in
                        the old drums, play
                        guitars as insanely loud and noisy as you hear on this track, and call it Hangover Studios. We
                        alienated a whole lot of
                        neighbors, made friends of convenience with others, and I’m proud to keep calling a handful of
                        them friends to this day.
                        We were 110% powered by six packs of Budweiser heavy tall boys from the bodega across the street
                        and plentiful cheap
                        weed. I got bedbugs, I had panic attacks, and I had so much fun despite how awful everything was
                        that I didn’t care at
                        all.

                        guitar, lowering a mic stand, raising up a drum throne. This remains one of my favorite songs of

                      <p>“Confidence Man” is a song I worked on in fits and starts for years after coming up with the
                        chords. Like a lot of songs
                        I wrote back then, it was about all these feelings and things I thought I knew or wanted, but
                        didn’t realize back then
                        that I didn’t understand or need. Anyway, Confidence Man is the long name for a con man, so just
                        keep that in mind here
                        as you consider my exquisitely complicated lyrical strings of references and allusions, and then
                        consider whether you
                        should listen to me or I’m full of shit. Sometimes I think this is the best song I ever wrote
                        for MD, and once in a
                        while I wonder if it might be the best song I ever wrote, period. It’s a real burner, in large
                        part due to Mattio’s
                        furious drumming. It hits the peak of <span class="highlighter">what I love about 80s/90s indie
                          rock and noise pop.</span> Evan did not learn and has
                        never learned how to play the rhythm guitar line to this song, which means this was basically
                        the one song he played
                        bass on forever and every screaming in-the-red guitar you hear here is me playing my heart right
                        out of my chest.

                      <p>I asked Chris what his inspiration for this song was, and he said “Romanticism in the Twentieth
                        Century” which is the
                        kind of answer that made me feel like I should have paid more attention in school, read more
                        books, and understood how
                        it all worked together. But I understood what Chris was doing with his suspended chords, roots,
                        and ringing b and e
                        strings. We played this for a long time, and my drumming kept getting better because I was
                        inspired to keep up with my
                        brilliant boys. I know it’s small, but I’m proud of the crash on the two of the chorus. I have a
                        memory of playing this
                        at Lakeside Lounge - one of the many wonderful small bars and venues we played at that are now
                        gone, victims of
                        skyrocketing rents - and being on full autopilot: <span class="highlighter">the tempo too fast,
                          but completely locked in,</span> as the song just moved

                        Matt’s (Jack Crank?)
                        laid down a super sick burn on me while we were ripping into this mid-show in the basement at
                        the Charleston, yet
                        another north Brooklyn dive on our hit list but this one uniquely prominent for serving a free
                        pizza with every beer if
                        you asked for it. He was all like, “What is this, a Police song??” I did not take it well, even
                        though I love Andy
                        Summers’ guitar sound. Seriously though, this song has got hooks for days, if I do say so
                        myself.

                      <p>I 100% was thinking of The Police when I suggested we go to half-time for the pre-chorus in
                        this. This song became an
                        anchor of live shows. We’d play at Lakeside Lounge (a stage hooked up by Roscoe, a great guy and
                        true lifelong rock and
                        roller who was a bud through the bike scene, who’d invite the other bike nerds for two-for-one
                        happy hour during the
                        Tour de France recap and let us bring our bikes inside the bar), or Piano’s, or Goodbye Blue
                        Monday, or the Charleston.
                        We got in touch with a “music promoter” who scored us more shows as long as we could get people
                        in the door and buying
                        drinks. Our friends patiently kept showing up - though I can remember one late Tuesday show on
                        the Lower East Side when
                        our only person in the audience for our 11PM set was Evan’s girlfriend. Now wife, for what it’s
                        worth.

                        This song was a mainstay of the dive-bar years: turn up the gain, fret those power chords, and
                        plan to clean up the pint
                        of beer you’re about to send tumbling from atop your amplifier. Some of my strongest memories
                        from those days are
                        actually about the other bands we tended to share the stage with -- bands with names like the
                        Affected Affections, or
                        Pieces, or Slow/Dynamite; bands whose mp3’s will occasionally show up on an old hard drive of
                        mine and make me smile. It
                        wasn’t quite a scene, but there was a small group of us noise-makers for a year or two there to
                        set up shows with and
                        trade EPs, share drum kits with or loan a ¼” cable too.

                      <p>This is a song that still makes me smile, one of the first were I really embraced the “make
                        some noise” approach to lead
                        guitar that we were learning by listening to a *lot* of the Chapel Hill greats in the car on the
                        way to gigs.
                        This is *the* Maxwell’s Demon song of the B-Sides and Rarities era for me. I was always happy to
                        play it on stage. I was
                        always happy to track it. Even today when Chris and I are in a room with guitars together I want
                        to play it.
                        I don’t remember the actual conversation, but at some point while working on this song there was
                        some moment where I
                        asked permission of Chris to just make Archers-of-Loaf-like noises with my guitar rather than
                        write any lead part, and
                        it couldn’t have worked out any better.

                        band), this song wound up hitting one of the big sweet spots for us: cacophonous guitars backing
                        up a melody you could
                        sing along to, delivering lyrics about flailing around in our early adulthood.

                      <p>I like to call this song the feel good hit of the summer of 2008, even if almost no one
                        listened to it. A classic CJN
                        mid-tempo indie rock groover with nasty lyrics and a lot of fuzz. I still think about those
                        indie rock shows at McCarren
                        Pool in Williamsburg and all the way-too-cool-for-me girls there. This was probably the closest
                        we got to that 90s
                        Chapel Hill sound I was so often going for. I wonder if we had released this song (the whole
                        debut full-length, really)
                        like five to ten years later, once 80s/90s indie rock became trendy influences again for the
                        kids, if anything would
                        have been any different. Probably not. But when the kids can write pop songs these days with
                        titles like “I Wish I Was
                        Stephen Malkmus”, heck why not?

                        moody jazz rock and
                        Chris’s chunky noise pop I groped around for a sound to call my own. Not a stretch to say it’s a
                        metaphor for my mid
                        twenties. I’m not sure it was a great idea to write a sixty second song about loneliness, insist
                        we record it to my
                        exacting specifications, and never really learn to play it as a band… but my idea to feedback
                        right in to the intro of
                        Tin Airplanes was one of my few inspired recording decisions for B-Sides and Rarities.

                        making things lo-fi and
                        “tapey,” but it really perfectly captures the best of what we were trying to do. Tin Airplanes
                        was a little jam I’d written in drop-D, trying to marry a bluesy riff with noise. It’s not my
                        strongest
                        effort, but the decision to pair it with Fireproof Safe was a good one, and listening back to
                        the whole thing now,
                        there’s a bit of a Sparklehorse flavor to it that I dig.

                        indie rock that was largely disconnected from the reality of the late Aughts. We were recording
                        on a laptop with Pro
                        Tools! What was I thinking? But we did experiment with some cool production techniques here and
                        there regardless, and
                        the combo of Fireproof Safe into Tin Airplanes was the best experimental result on the album.
                        Evan’s half is a real
                        crawling king snake of a swamp jam, and when we played live I would get loud as hell on these

                        chorus, Chris getting noisy on the lead--we were listening to a lot of Archers of Loaf, a lot of
                        the Chapel Hill scene
                        bands, and it was fitting for this song about a heartbreak in the Research Triangle. I tried to
                        write a slower, twangier version of this later in my Otsego days, but to quote some R.E.M. liner
                        notes, this
                        version crushes that one like a grape.

                      <p>So we recorded our album and got tired of gigging it and road tripped separately and got fired
                        or broken-up with or
                        priced out of the neighborhood. We got into the occasional knock-down, grudge-holding argument,
                        and we came back
                        together to work on a new set of songs. There was more distortion, more delay. Chris and I both
                        got a lot better at
                        drumming and Evan started writing rock songs like Raleigh. We thought harder about the
                        transitions in our songs - we
                        wrote tiny pieces of them, just really writing the shit out of how small parts fit together -
                        and they became some of
                        the best damn songs we never recorded. We got tight and strong in our live shows. Kevin didn’t
                        show up to one of them
                        and suddenly we were a three-piece for a little while, until Jean-Claude learned bass and backup
                        vox for all of our
                        songs (and did an amazing delivery of Superstition for our annual New Years’ covers set). But
                        all that’s left of that
                        magical year is a few CDs of sets recorded off the soundboard (one is strong; another, a true
                        trainwreck of a gig), a
                        bad taste left in our mouths from so-called music promoters who let you do all the promotion but
                        took a cut from the
                        door, and the memory of a lot of good bars that aren’t around anymore in neighborhoods we can no
                        longer afford.

                      <p>I remember playing this tune live onstage at Piano’s on the Lower East Side the night we
                        recorded this and the rest of
                        the songs-for-a-second-album that never made it into the studio. I forgot to turn up my guitar
                        at first and I thought it
                        was gonna wreck the cut because I couldn’t get the balance right, but it didn’t matter because
                        Matt was so insane on the
                        kit for this song. We had gotten a lot tighter and a lot better at each of our instruments by
                        then, especially the
                        drums, and our live shows were really showing it even though our local venues and bars were
                        already starting to close by
                        then due to the changing winds in the city. We never captured our live power in the studio, but
                        I’m glad we have a
                        document of our concert presence, which had gotten massive even though the end of the band was
                        already starting to loom
                        in the lyrics to these songs. Kevin had disappeared, and Jean-Claude picked up the bass to
                        become our favorite fourth
                        member. Hangover Studios gave way briefly to a practice space in Astoria and then to the
                        legendary Castle Asshole when I
                        moved into Bushwick’s notoriously disgusting McKibbin Lofts with the guys in my metal band
                        Predator Raw. Everything in
                        life was getting grosser by the day.

                      <p>If I had a dollar for every time I’ve sung this chorus in my head, I wouldn’t need any of the
                        jobs that called it forth.
                        It was in my head when I made $500 a month running a soundboard. It was in my head when I got
                        paid under the table to
                        work the cash register at a bicycle shop. More recently, a couple of multi-national corporate
                        employers have caused me
                        to hum along as well. This is one of those songs that I feel like I was still working on when we
                        stopped playing out. My part was 80% of the
                        way there. Chris’ rhythm was great, and he and Matt really locked in. One of the things I miss
                        the most about playing
                        music out live is how every song constantly changes, evolves, and grows, as you write it
                        together anew on stage.

                        from one job, having
                        another not renew a contract, scrounging part time jobs through a recession or two, delivering
                        food on my bike
                        through two nasty winters to lower Manhattan elite who didn’t tip for shit, I realized that
                        there’s artistry, not
                        artlessness, in being blunt. I tried to put as much fury into my drumming as Chris put into his
                        words, while Evan
                        anchored the chaos with a really cool rhythmic lead line.

                      <p>The game was getting pretty raw for young broke people in New York by 2009. I was laid off from
                        my financial due
                        diligence “private investigation” job in October 2008 early in the economic crash and remained
                        out of work for nine long
                        months, during which time I tried and failed to write a book, had a mental breakdown, and barely
                        kept it together until
                        I landed a job as a reporter the following summer (thanks again Bailey). And even after I got
                        that job I barely kept it
                        together. This song is about the job I got laid off from, and all the jobs we all hated we had
                        to have in the first
                        place given that all the jobs we thought we’d get were long gone. Things were hard and sometimes
                        ugly for young
                        working-age people in the Great Recession, especially when piles of student debt were involved.
                        But it was a beautiful
                        time even though a lot of it hurt, and I tried to catch all of that in this song.

                      <p>I love this song. I love playing this song. Chris’ mom was practically my second mom for all
                        the weekends I spent holed
                        up in their attic with a guitar in high school, then on breaks from college, then sometimes just
                        a fun visit after
                        college. Karen let us make a ruckus and a mess in her house, and was still somehow always happy
                        to see us, and I am
                        still very happy when I get to see her. To add a few notes to an ode to her was always a
                        privilege. Add to that the fact
                        that Chris’ lyrics just captured perfectly that odd feeling of starting an adult life at home,
                        conceptually distant but
                        geographically close to the people who raised you -- that even after returning home, we can’t go
                        home again -- and this
                        is a song that still makes me misty-eyed to play.

                        days for me, and a lot of those tough times are represented in these lyrics. But this song tries
                        to put the tough stuff
                        in perspective, since there’s no other way to grow up and stay alive.

                      <p>One of my all-time favorite songs I’ve ever been a part of. Every memory I have of this song
                        involves sidling up to the
                        mic next to mattio, belting out backup vocals while trying to keep up for dear life with my
                        right hand. As I remember it, this was the first song of a new, more confident style of writing,
                        where the main songwriter (Matt in
                        this case) would bring what he had to the group, we would write parts around it, and then he
                        would write a *new* part to
                        replace the original. I don’t remember if that’s exactly how this played out but it’s a method
                        I’ve used a lot since. When we played it live we played it fast, and sometimes, when we hit that
                        outro just right, with Matt strumming
                        furiously, it felt like maybe, just maybe, we could be opening for Mission of Burma in the
                        Signals, Calls and Marches
                        era. I feel like this was a song where we’d really matured as a band, and it’s a regret of mine
                        that we never properly
                        tracked this one.

                      <p>Liam was a traveler I met who had set out to walk across the country. We had a few friends in
                        common. The last I heard
                        of him, a friend saw him in jail in NYC during the RNC. He cut his walk short - he’d gotten
                        lonely. I’m still not
                        entirely sure what he was looking for, but at the time I wrote the song some years later, I knew
                        what it meant to be
                        looking for something. But a bunch of years past graduation, burning through jobs at an
                        unsustainable rate, constantly
                        cash-strapped, and staring down a year of recession, I didn’t know what there was to hope for
                        and worried that
                        everything we leaned on - yeah, even the music - just wasn’t going to get us through.

                      <p>We were at the peak of our power as a live trio by the time Matt wrote this tune, and it became
                        our most locked-in
                        groove of the late era of MD. I was finally ok at drums and I felt like a well-oiled murderous
                        robot when we played this
                        one live. There’s definitely some other influences creeping into the band by the time you hear
                        these later tracks,
                        beyond just traditionally noisy indie rock. There’s a sense of rhythm and interplay we didn’t
                        have before, something we
                        picked up over time from other bands we loved like Spoon who we weren’t good enough to
                        successfully imitate until we
                        were almost done as a band. I tried to play drums like my name was Jim Eno, but I wound up
                        sounding like Sam Fogarino.

                      <p>Early in my experience as a worker, after the thrill of the first few paychecks went away, I’d
                        start to get the sneaking
                        suspicion that I was being exploited - that I was giving away my brain for eight hours a day to
                        somebody under no
                        obligation to return it in one piece. This song is about the terribly stupid anti-terrorism
                        emergency evacuation
                        procedures we got at a job in a building near the Empire State Building, which was as much a
                        part of working in NYC in
                        the Aughts as active shooter drills in schools a decade later. One thing I’ve realized about
                        getting older is that in
                        life, I wind up learning the same lessons over and over, with new depth that comes with
                        repetition. The last year or two
                        we spent as a proper band we stumbled toward writing what’s essentially grunge music, I think,
                        and after spending our
                        early twenties trying to get a leg up in a world that was just starting to pinball from one
                        crisis to another, we
                        returned to what we learned at kids from the suburbs in the 1990s: success sucks and is dumb,
                        chunky guitars and
                        heartbeat drums are good.

                      <p>Matt was at the top of his game writing this song, and the combo of his lyrics and vocal
                        delivery here are all-time tops
                        for me. He captured the raw awfulness of so much of that era’s economy in our generation’s early
                        working adulthood. This
                        is another one where I felt like I was finally getting where I could do interesting things on
                        the drums, and the build
                        of this tune to the crashing end was a showstopper in concert. This song and many of the other
                        Live at Piano’s tracks
                        captured the nasty vibes of the city that shut us down in the end and led us off to other
                        adventures. By the time we
                        played our farewell show at the Lakeside Lounge in the summer of 2010, we’d been playing guitars
                        together for nearly a
                        decade, from our very first baby steps in the months before 9/11 all the way through adolescence
                        and whatever’s after it
                        until the Tea Party took over Congress. You can hear why it was all ending in the lyrics we were
                        all writing by then.
                        From the very first jam we always wanted something more than the bullshit we were sold, but we
                        didn’t find it in that
                        decade. What we did find were what we now like to call the “garbage days”: a lot of really good
                        times we didn’t always
                        appreciate when they were happening, because, after all, they were happening to us. Those
                        garbage days might have been a
                        hot mess, but our trash fires looked gorgeous as they burned.

                      <p>This song got lost in our catalog. It wasn’t guitar-based. No amplifier threatened to blow a
                        fuse when you played it.
                        While everything else we were playing out was meant to sizzle, this was meant to smolder. I was
                        also deeply
                        uncomfortable about singing in those days, and this vocal take took a while. But when I listen
                        to it now, I love it.
                        This was like Love Song for Liam -- the rare song where by the end of it the only thing left
                        from the demo were the
                        lyrics and maybe some of the chord progression. We truly wrote this collaboratively, tearing
                        down what I came in with
                        and building it anew. Since we never really played it out, my memories of it are all from
                        writing it with Matt and Chris
                        and Kevin. And because of that -- and because it didn’t fit neatly into any of what we were
                        playing out at that point --
                        it reminds me for all the world of the earliest days in the band, young teens gathered around a
                        single-deck
                        cassette-tape recorder in a barn in Ho-Ho-Kus, all of us looking at each other quizzically as
                        the sustain dies off as if
                        to say, “We’re doing this, right?”

                      <p>I distinctly remember Evan bringing this song to a session of ours down in DC, and how we all
                        took Evan’s blues riff and
                        cut it to pieces together, with Chris working the synth, Kevin on keys, and me tapping
                        harmonics. Weeks later Chris sent
                        us an MP3 - he’d sat through most of the song before bringing in the tick tock of the drum, a
                        goddamn brilliant bit of
                        patience, and the whole thing just feels like a beautiful rainy night to me. Do young people
                        always know that they’re
                        planting nostalgia for their future selves? I think we played this once, at Wesleyan University,
                        in the graffiti’ed
                        basement of Westco. I only know because Evan’s standing at the mic alone and I’m sitting on the
                        floor.

                        Rarities”, only to have
                        that title ring depressingly true over a decade later. We’ve got nothing but rarities at this
                        point, but Bus Stop is a
                        particularly rare tropical bird in the menagerie. Evan stirred up some spooky vibes and we made
                        something unlike any
                        other tune in our catalog. This recording was my final project for an audio engineering class
                        senior year of college. I
                        got an A.

                      <p>I learned to play guitar hanging out in the attic bedroom of my high school best friend. So
                        much of my experience of
                        playing music -- and all the ways it has enriched my life since Maxwell’s Demon called it quits
                        -- can be traced back to
                        just being a kid hanging out with my friends. And so this goofy song about watching younger kids
                        playing from the window
                        across the street has an honesty that all the other wrought-and-overwrought songs we wrote can’t
                        touch. This is another
                        rare occurrence of me picking up the bass guitar, which is still something I only do in the
                        presence of friends who are
                        willing to let some errant notes slide.

                      <p>Our friend Laura paid about as much attention to our band - and to us as people - as anybody in
                        our lives, especially in
                        that turbulent part of our early 20s when we felt confused and alone no matter how many
                        wonderful people we surrounded
                        ourselves with. She called this “the only truly happy song that Maxwell’s Demon wrote.” Which
                        only gets truer in
                        hindsight when we revisit the overwhelming nostalgia written into this song a decade and a half
                        later, to think of the
                        times we had together as a band, to worry that they’re behind us, and the final kicker, to
                        realize that we never really
                        did this song justice in the studio or stage. We played it out some, but did we know what a
                        banger we had on our hands?
                        But we still have each other. And I think at the end of the day, pulling together these stories
                        and these tracks were -
                        like being in the band in the first place - as much an excuse for us to spend time together as
                        it was a means to make
                        music. It’s all the same thing, anyway.

                        the overarching vision
                        of this song as we watched our neighbors across the street from our bedroom windows and goofed
                        around. Some of the
                        earliest versions I have of these lyrics are written in Katie’s hand, even. Even though the
                        recorded version has never
                        seen the light of day until now, Foursquare has always been a live fan favorite, goofy as it may
                        be, probably because
                        it’s such a naively straightforward charmer that it walks right in your front door before you

                        this was a natural pick to repurpose as a parody version for Evan’s wedding many years later.
                        Later that wedding night,
                        I toasted Evan and Lauren with a reference to our years together in this very band, of love and
                        music and learning new
                        languages together through shared lives. No other band has come close to the musical
                        relationships I forged with these
                        guys in MD because you don’t get another shot at being young and dumb together, too ignorant and
                        arrogant to know
                        better. “Yes,” we’d say, “we don’t know what we’re doing, but we do it better than you.”

                        as loud as back then. You can also find him livestreaming home studio jams on Twitch on the
