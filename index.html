                        one
                        later Le Samourai song. If I
                        remember correctly,
                        someone took a handheld recorder to the escalators of one PATH station or another to get that
                        little
                        sound bed under the

                      <p>Being teenagers in New Jersey in the 1990s meant we were always looking for <span
                          class="highlighter">something
                          better.</span> I
                        would fill the gas tank
                        in my parents' station wagon with a twenty and cross county lines to pick up Evan, take him to
                        Chris’s, and then we’d go
                        to Guitar Center to noodle and dream. "Fake Plastic Trees" and other songs about the suburbs
                        were in
                        the tape deck. We
                        knew New York City. We were raised to believe that the world was ours, and we didn't want it -
                        we
                        wanted something
                        realer. We were smart, I guess, but nobody is wise at that age. Still, Evan could really dish
                        out
                        some poetry from
                        behind an acoustic guitar: "There must be someone out there trying to talk to us". <span

                      <p>This song by Evan holds up the best out of anything from the first era of the band, back when
                        we called ourselves Green
                        (after talking Mattio out of “The Normal”). We tracked this in my bedroom in Glen Rock like so
                        much of the stuff we
                        recorded early in college, after our earliest high school days jamming and four-tracking in the
                        loft of the Barn at Aunt
                        Patty’s place nearby. This was probably the last song where I played bass on record before
                        switching to six-string and
                        drums. I hear this and think of those <span class="highlighter">night drives on the
                          Turnpike</span> and the rest of the awful web
                        of north Jersey
                        highways, of running with guitars slung over shoulders and amps lashed onto rattly handcarts to
                        catch train rides over
                        and under swamps and rivers. We met in high school in New York, and finally moved there years
                        later, but New Jersey is
                        where our music came from, at least in 2004.

                      <p>Having made it through years spent recording the terrible and long jams of beginners and
                        learners,
                        now exploring our
                        world as songwriters, we took another step. We got better at the drums though none of us was a
                        drummer. Chris abandoned
                        the bass in favor of the guitar and the pen. We found the pitch - most of the time. And so by
                        the
                        time I graduated from
                        college - with Evan and Chris soon to follow - those barn jams and bedroom practice
                        sessions resulted in
                        Signal-to-Noise, <span class="highlighter">fully equipped</span> as a rock band with our own
                        tentative
                        drumming, more distortion, and
                        one less
                        instrumental jam than Fitter/Happier. “Big World” was a big step forward for us in precision
                        - not the least of which involved the tiny turns of the knob on Chris’s Marshall amp to get the
                        perfect delay timing on
                        my rhythm guitar.

                      <p>“Big World” wasn’t just the first time I ever played drums on a track: it was practically the
                        first time I ever played
                        drums, period. I had gone back to the Barn, dug up my cousin Brennan’s battered old drum set
                        from his 90s NJ punk/ska
                        band, and dragged it up to my attic room in Glen Rock. We only had a high-hat cymbal, no crash
                        or ride. I had been
                        playing guitar for a while by then but had never been confident in my early attempts at
                        songwriting until this point,
                        and adding drums to the mix seemed like a good idea too. It was the summer of 2005, after
                        sophomore year of college, and
                        I was an intern at Men’s Health Magazine in New York. We spent a weekend in the Glen Rock attic
                        to record the whole
                        Signal to Noise EP, and we were having such a time <span class="highlighter">I called in sick to
                          work</span> Monday with the “stomach flu” so we could
                        finish the job. Upon my return to work, my editor made me write a sidebar piece (ostensibly for
                        the magazine) about why
                        there is technically no such thing as the stomach flu. It is actually called gastroenteritis, a
                        kindly doctor informed
                        me. Whatever you call it, I didn’t have it. <span class="attr">-CJN</span></p>

                        microphones we bought for the Barn (I last used mine to record lead guitar a year ago - still
                        kicking). This song always
                        makes me think of our sneaking into <span class="highlighter">some now-dead bar</span> or

                        something. This was
                        the era when we realized our guitars would make big loud noises if we let them, and we began to
                        spend a lot of time just
                        letting the texture of the sound run wild
